# Crypto Data Analysis: Bitcoin Price History

This is a small Python project where I analyze historical Bitcoin price data and visualize how the price has changed over time.

## What this project does
- Loads historical BTC price data
- Organizes the data into a clean table
- Builds a simple and clear price chart

## Tools used
- Python  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Result
The notebook produces a line chart showing Bitcoin price dynamics over time.  
This helps to quickly understand general trends and market behavior.

## Why I built this
This project is part of my learning path in data analysis and crypto analytics.  
The goal is to practice working with real data, visualization, and a proper GitHub workflow.
